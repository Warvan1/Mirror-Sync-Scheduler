# MIRROR_SYNC_SCHEDULER
The Sync Scheduler is in charge of updating the repositories for all of the projects within https://mirror.clarkson.edu/projects. To do this it reads the mirrors.json file and creates a schedule of when each project wants to run based on the number of times each day each project wants to sync and the lcm of all the task frequencies. The Sync Scheduler then uses this schedule to add tasks to the queue. The Queue is first in first out and uses threads to run up to a set number of tasks at the same time.

The multithreaded queue is the best approach because we don’t want every project syncing at the same time at midnight (pure threaded approach). We also don’t want each task running one at a time as that could create some long queue times as the queue backs up.

To sync the projects we have 2 options rsync and script. There are also some projects that have 2 or 3 stage rsync's. And a few rsync projects use a password. All of these cases are handled for each project.

The Sync Scheduler connects to the log server that Juno made https://github.com/lavajuno/mirrorlog. Using the class that cary made https://github.com/carykees98/mirror-logging.

### Config env.json
- if dryrun is set to true it wont run the rsync commands and will instead sleep for 10 seconds and print. (used for testing)
- queueThreads is the number of threads the queue uses to run tasks.
- logServerPort is the port that the scheduler tries to connect to the log server on.

### Things to add
- Connect to dispatch
- Connect to website for manual sync
